      <div class="site-block-header__description">
        <p>The Data at the Point of Care is a pilot program that aims to enable healthcare providers in delivering high quality care directly to Medicare beneficiaries by making a patient's Medicare claims data available to the provider for treatment needs. The information can be accessed in the existing workflow and without logging into another application or portal.  Claims information can be used to confirm information, fill in gaps in care, and improve patient safety. The Data at the Point of care pilot program includes data from inpatient, outpatient, and pharmacy claims with diagnoses, procedures, preventive tests, medications, hospital admissions, and visit information for outpatient, urgent care, and emergency rooms.</p>
