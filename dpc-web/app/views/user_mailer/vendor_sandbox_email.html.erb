    <p>
      Congratulations! You have now been given access to the Data at the Point of Care sandbox! Once you follow the steps below, you will be able to develop and test your solution to retrieve important health history for your provider partners' Original Medicare patients. We are eager to learn how the data is used, especially in cases such as understanding a patient's past history, knowing what preventive items have been performed or are needed, staying updated on what happens to patients in between visits, and being informed of the medication fill information for patients. We know you will find innovative ways to use the data, and we look forward to hearing about your experiences.
    </p>
