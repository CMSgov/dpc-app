# Generating the Source Code Documentation via JavaDoc

The entire project's code base documentation can be generated in HTML format by using the Java's
JavaDoc tool. The [Intelli-J Idea](https://jetbrains.com/idea) integrated development environment makes this easy to do. Navigate to the **Tools>Generate JavaDoc** menu item, specify the scope of the documentation and the output location, and you'll be able to view an interactive document outlining the code members.
