# Sample Data

The following sample data can be used to test the CMS Data at the Point of Care (DPC) API Sandbox.  The provided sample data was generated using the excellent [Synthea](https://synthea.mitre.org) tool 
with some specific modifications that are required by the DPC project, which are documented at the end of this README.

The files needed to create a simulated data set in your environment are
- [practitioner_bundle.json](./practitioner_bundle.json): A `Bundle` of `Practitioner` resources which have been generated by Synthea and modified to allow matching with the sample `Patient` resources.
Details on the data modifications are given [here](#practitioners).
- [patient_bundle-dpr.json](./patient_bundle-dpr.json) A `Bundle` of `Patient` resources which have been generated by Synthea with IDs matching the BlueButton sandbox environment. 
- [group_bundle_practioner_xxxxxx.json](./xxxxx.json) A `Bundle` of `Group` resources that are matched to the `Practitioner` resource [PracitionerName].  The Group resource creates a collection of `Patient` and `Practitioner` resources that are attributed to one another. 
--There will be 4 separate Group files ,  one for each practitioner
- [endpoint_bundle.json](./organization_bundle.json): A `Bundle` of 1 `Endpoint` resources that can be resgitered to your Organization.

# Data Modifications 

## Practitioners

- Removed fullURL
- Manually modified IDs to match [test_associations](./test_associations.csv).

## Patients

- Added MBIs to match to match the attributions.
- Normalized some of the language codes to ensure that they match the corresponding FHIR value sets/


## Endpoints

- Manually created (and linked) test FHIR endpoints
- Added missing (and required) address type/use fields
